Simple tool to show disk contents

Improvements to be done
-

- [ ] data-time before log messages
- [ ] disable update button while updating...
- [ ] progress bar
- [ ] partial analysis: only analyse a folder
- [ ] show advices and potential space gain (temp folders, download folders, caches, recycle bin, windows restore points,...)
- [ ] see installed apps and games
- [ ] see in explorer
- [ ] speed up the process
- [ ] dynamic updates
- [ ] logical drives
- [ ] "Files as a folder"

I can retrieve all files in one pass with SearchOption.AllDirectories
